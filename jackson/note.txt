To use readData.py:
Create regions of background values to be averaged in Carta, then export background regions
using statistics widget in Carta. Organize all .tsv files into folders with the name of the
sensor that was used (ie ngc4548_irac1_gauss7p5, ngc4548_irac1_gauss15, ...) After files
have been organized into appropiate folders, open readData.py and change the value of 
directoryToBeScanned to the name of the root directory that contains the organized folders.
Then run readData.py and it should leave a stats.txt file in the root directory with
appropiately weighted background values.
